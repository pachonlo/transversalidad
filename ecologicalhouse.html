    <h2 class="end">Conclusion</h2>
    <h3 class="info-conclu">To put an end to this great transversal project<br>
        in which we have worked with a lot of effort and dedication, we created<br>
        an ecological house that offers us a sustainable solution to reduce the<br>
        environmental impact and improve the quality of life. Although it may involve<br>
        additional costs, the long-term benefits are significant, both for the environment<br>
        and for residents. It is an investment in a more sustainable future.<br><br>
        Finally, we want to thank the teachers who supported us during the project and<br>
        our teammates, without whom nothing would have been done.</h3>
